# DTP Attack on Misconfigured Network

Author: Abdelrahman Adel
Date: 2022

## Overview

This README provides an overview of a Python script designed to attack a misconfigured network that utilizes Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)-enabled switches. DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol used for negotiating trunking on network links. In cases of misconfiguration, attackers can exploit DTP to manipulate network settings.

## DTP Exploitation

The Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) can be exploited in scenarios where network interfaces are misconfigured. This script captures DTP packets, modifies them, and sends them back to the target network. By doing so, it can change the status of DTP interfaces, potentially causing network disruption.

## Usage

To use the DTP Attack on Misconfigured Network script, follow these steps:

1. Review the script to understand its purpose and potential impact.

2. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed, including Scapy. You can install Scapy using pip:

   pip install scapy OR python3 -m pip install scapy

   
3. Customize the script to target a specific network or test environment. Make sure you have proper authorization and ethical reasons for running this script.

4. Run the script with caution, in a controlled, authorized environment. Monitor the network during the script's execution to understand its impact.

5. Ensure that you are conducting the operation for educational purposes or authorized network testing.

## Safeguards and Countermeasures

It is essential to safeguard your network against DTP exploitation and unauthorized network changes. Consider the following safeguards:

1. **DTP Configuration**: Properly configure DTP on network devices and ensure that all interfaces are set to the desired mode (access or trunk). Disable DTP where it is not needed.

2. **Network Monitoring**: Use network monitoring tools to detect and respond to unexpected changes in network protocols.

3. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Deploy IDS to monitor and detect suspicious network activity, including abnormal DTP behavior.

## Note

Please use these safeguards and countermeasures responsibly. Unauthorized or malicious use of network attack techniques can have legal and ethical consequences. Network security is vital for maintaining a reliable and secure network environment.

By understanding and implementing safeguards, you can protect your network from DTP exploitation and other network security risks.
