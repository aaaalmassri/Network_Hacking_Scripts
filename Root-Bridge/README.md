Author: Abdelrahman Adel
Date: 2022

## Overview

The Fake Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Root Bridge Attack script is a Python tool designed to impersonate the root bridge of a network by sending fake STP Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) packets. This attack can potentially disrupt network operations and cause network convergence problems. 

The script uses the Scapy library to sniff, modify, and send STP packets. It's essential to use this script responsibly and for educational purposes only to understand STP attacks and how to defend against them.

## Motivation

As Abraham Lincoln once said, "The best way to predict the future is to create it." This script serves as an educational tool to create awareness of STP vulnerabilities and the importance of securing network protocols. Understanding the risks involved in STP attacks can help network administrators and security professionals better protect their networks.

## Usage

To use the Fake STP Root Bridge Attack script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the Scapy library installed. You can install it using pip:

pip install scapy OR python3 -m pip install scapy 


2. Review the script to understand its purpose and potential impact.

3. Run the script with caution, as it can disrupt network operations. Ensure that you have appropriate authorization and are conducting this operation in a controlled and authorized environment.

4. Use this script exclusively for educational purposes to study STP attacks and defense mechanisms.
